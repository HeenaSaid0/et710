    As an iPhone 6s user, I don’t really see the iPhone 7 being a big deal. I feel as though the same thing comes out every year but just a little bit better. For example, the iPhone 6 is now slimmer than the iPhone 7, having new colors added. The biggest difference is there’s no headphone jack on iPhone 7. Instead are new Apple AirPods which are completely wireless. But now people will have to require an adapter for existing headphones. But I don’t really like the look of them and feel that the wired headphones are better. The biggest advantage of the iPhone 7 I like is it being water resistant.
    This means they can survive immersion in water for 30 minutes down to a depth of one meter. You’ll be able to even take photos underwater.
